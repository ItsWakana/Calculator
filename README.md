# Calculator

This calculator project really helped solidify my usage of arrays a lot more. Most of my calculations were done by pushing the user inputs into an array and then using reduce methods to calculate a specific operator that was pressed. 

I had some difficulty dealing with the arrays and carrying over numbers from different user actions but I feel a lot more confident in those areas than I did when i started.
